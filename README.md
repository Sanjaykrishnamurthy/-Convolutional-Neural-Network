# -Convolutional-Neural-Network
This is a convolutional neural network trained with more than 15,000 dogs and cat images respectively. 
I have built this network three layers deep, giving an accuracy of 86%.

Libraries i used to build the above neural network are :
- KERAS (Tensorflow Backend)
- Tensorflow (For structuring the ANN)
- numpy (For numerical computations)
The above neural net is 4 layers deep and i even uploaded the weight values of my training session. I got 91% of training accuracy 
and 86% of testing accuracy.
